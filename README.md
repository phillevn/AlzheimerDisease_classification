# AlzheimerDisease_classification
We classify severity of Alzheimer Disease (AD) by using brain MRI images

In this project, our aim is to show how to use Bayesian deep learning in classifying images. This is just a small part of my current project regarding applying Bayesian statistics to predict early sign of having AD by using longitudinal method for brain MRI images together medical records, biomarkers, ... etc of patients. Notice that, with the current method, a patient is diagnosed AD now means that patient had AD for decades. Our model will improve accuracy and provide some uncertainty levels. We showed that it can make uncertain prediction of my headshot and provided that we should not believe the result of its prediction, which is important output in medical science. The model is especially important for data that is outside the training population.
